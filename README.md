# Salary-Management-Project
Salary Management System is an application that deals with everything related Money Management and Budgeting.
Our application uses simple tools and techniques to manage your money more effectively, conveniently and securely.
The application uses MySQL as the database which is also protected by a password to ensure your data is safe.
The application also uses smart budgeting techniques to auto calculate and make a budget for you without any intervention.
We can also show you detailed analysis through bar graphs and pie chart to get a detailed assessment of your expenditure and savings. These mesmerizing graphs and pie charts were made using matplotlib library with handpicked themes to enhance the key features.
The beautiful and minimal designs were made using tkinter library to not only make salary management user friendly but also fun and engaging.
Our program can be broadly divided into 5 features and functionalities:-

    1. Creation of tables in the respective database on any system just by entering the correct details on our login page. These tables cover all the categories namely-
    • Child Care – to keep track of money being spent for children.
    • Health Care – to keep track of money being spent on health care.
    • Housing – to keep track of money being spent on insurance, maintenance and rent and also the income from other houses.
    • Transportation – to track and analyze money being spent on commute and other general travel expenses.
    • Living expenses – which cover day to day expenses like groceries, entertainment etc.
    • Miscellaneous – to track the money spent on pets, hobbies, gifts, donations and to cover any other category not mentioned in the previous categories.
These databases are therefore created by our program automatically without any user interference on the click of 1 button.

    2. Entering values onto these tables, we have taken immense care in ensuring we boil down to every sub-category under our main category to ensure that user can get maximum coverage on their expenditure and therefore also see a clearer and more accurate analysis.
    
    3. Analysis of data using data visualization-this is the crux of our program, all the data entered for 12 months in a year can be individually viewed and assessed by the user. Using matplotlib library we analyzed the data from the user and used appropriate legends and labels for both bar graphs and pie charts.We begin by asking the user for which month he/she would like to view analysis of and proceed to display the table menu, and after the user chooses one and also chooses to view bar graph or pie chart we display them accordingly in the python output.



    4. Budgeting or should we say ‘Smart Budgeting, after having done some sophisticated research on this matter, we discovered the most popular and best budgeting technique to help our users and to reduce manual labor.We call it ‘Automatic Budgeting’ or ‘Autobudget’. Using a pre-written set of code we create a tailored budget for the user without his/her help. And these details are then displayed to user. If the user is unhappy with our autobudget we have also included an option for manual budget to enter their own values and make the required changes.

    5. Tracking budget-which is the application of making budget in the first place, here we ask the user for which month he/she would like to track budget for and then show a comparison between their budget and whether they remained under it or exceeded it, we also tell the user by how much money they defied their budget.
